Regarding mod file in go:
1. It allows you to specify which external packages your 
module depends on, making it easier to manage and maintain those dependencies.
2. The file helps track the version of dependencies, enabling reproducible builds.


Initialize a New Module:
go mod init <module-name>
This creates a new go.mod file for your project.


Add a Dependency:
go get <package>
This command fetches a new dependency and updates the go.mod file automatically.


Remove a Dependency:
go mod tidy
This cleans up the go.mod file by removing unused dependencies.


View Dependency Graph:
go mod graph
This shows the dependency graph of your module.


Update Dependencies:
go get -u
This command updates all dependencies to their latest versions.
