Browser Treatment
Rendering: By default, both <div> and <nav> are block-level elements, meaning they will occupy the full width available and start on a new line.
Semantic Meaning:
<div>: Generic, no semantic meaning. Often used for layout and styling.
<nav>: Semantic meaning indicating navigation links. Improves accessibility and SEO.
Default Styles: Browsers typically apply minimal default styles to these elements. The key difference lies in their semantic meaning.



By default, both sections will look identical to the user:

Links inside both <div> and <nav> will be rendered as inline elements.
They will appear next to each other if there is enough horizontal space. -->
